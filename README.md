# Ansible Testing
## Overview
This is a repository where I test playbooks and ad hoc commands on vagrant servers. I created 6 vagrant servers to run tests on, including the following...

- Installing Apache, nginx, sos, and postgresql
- Removing Apache, nginx, sos, and postgresql
- Posting results and messages to slack to inform user or users
- Running multiple adhoc commands in a playbook

There are modules for every kind of server, so there are an endless amount of things you can do with ansible!
